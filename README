An unofficial - personal implementation of the arimaa game as a two-player online browser-based game
containing such amazing features as:

* Visual indication of frozen pieces - dangerous moves (moves involving sacrifice or deliberately freezing a pieces), etc.
* Visual indication of number of steps remaining in the move.
* Prevention of illegal moves
* Nice animations of moves
* Server side verification of moves (whether legal, and who made the move)
* Minimal server side state
* Game log - who moved which pieces where and in what order.
